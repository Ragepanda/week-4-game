# Badlands the Game

This is a small RPG made using HTML, CSS, JQuery and JS. You can pick one of three characters, each of which have a pool of hitpoints, and a hidden attack value. Some of them have higher attack values at the start, some have low ones that increase for each time they attack. Picking your fights unwisely will result in a loss.
